# Assembly

I've done quite a bit of fiddling with the assembly language in my first year of Uni and have grown to like it. 
A couple of more noticeable projects of mine are:

:white_check_mark: Expression computer in post-fixed polish notation
:white_check_mark: A game of Sudoku translated from C++
